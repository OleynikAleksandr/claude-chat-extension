# Release Notes - v0.12.16

## ðŸŽ¯ Final Polish & Token Progress Animation

### Status Bar Color Fix
- **Exact green color match** - "Assistant Ready For Next Task" now uses `#00ff00`
- **Consistent with token indicator** - Same bright green as the progress bar
- **Visual harmony** - No more color mismatch between components

### Token Progress Bar Animation
- **Smooth growth animation** - Progress bar grows from 0% with fluid motion
- **Cubic bezier easing** - Natural acceleration/deceleration curve
- **0.6s duration** - Noticeable but not distracting animation time
- **Initial appearance** - Bar elegantly animates in from the left when tokens first appear
- **Continuous transitions** - Smooth animations between all token count changes

### Technical Details
- Added `growFromLeft` keyframe animation for initial bar appearance
- Increased transition time from 0.3s to 0.6s for smoother changes
- Used `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)` for more natural motion
- Both green and warning zones animate consistently

### Visual Improvements Summary
This release completes the visual polish of the status bar and progress indicators:
- Perfect color consistency across all UI elements
- Smooth, professional animations

- Harmonious design throughout the extension

The extension now provides a cohesive, polished user experience with attention to every visual detail.
