# Release Notes - v0.12.14

## ðŸŽ¯ Fixed Status Bar Pulsing Animation

### Changes
- Fixed pulsing animation logic for tool statuses
- Tool statuses now continuously pulse while displayed
- Only "Assistant Ready For Next Task" shows without animation

### Technical Details
- Modified `ServiceInfoBlock.tsx` to keep `isProcessing: true` for saved tool statuses
- Ensures continuous visual feedback while tools are being referenced
- Maintains static display only for the ready state

### Visual Behavior
- **During tool usage**: Continuous pulsing animation
- **Tool status persists**: Keeps pulsing even when showing last used tool
- **Assistant ready**: Static text "Assistant Ready For Next Task" without animation

This provides clearer visual distinction between active tool states and the ready state.
