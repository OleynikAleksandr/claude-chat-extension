# Release Notes - v0.12.15

## ðŸŽ¯ Enhanced Status Bar Design & Path Truncation

### Visual Improvements
- **Double height status bar** - Increased from 22px to 44px to accommodate two lines of text
- **Assistant-style alignment** - Status bar now matches assistant message layout:
  - 16px padding from edges (same as messages container)
  - 90% max width (same as assistant messages)
  - Left-aligned with same visual style
  - Matching background color and opacity (0.8)

### Path Truncation Feature
- **Smart middle truncation** - Long file paths are truncated in the middle
- **Preserved information** - Always shows:
  - Beginning of the path (to understand location)
  - Full filename (most important part)
  - Middle section replaced with "..."
- **Maximum 80 characters** - Ensures readability on various screen sizes
- **Multi-line support** - Text can wrap to second line when needed

### Technical Details
- Added `truncatePathMiddle()` function for intelligent path shortening
- Updated CSS for multi-line text support with proper word wrapping
- Status bar now visually consistent with chat message bubbles

### Example
Before: `/Users/username/very/long/path/to/project/src/components/SomeComponent.tsx`
After: `/Users/username/very/...roject/src/components/SomeComponent.tsx`

This ensures the status bar remains readable while showing all essential information.
