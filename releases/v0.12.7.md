# Release v0.12.7 - Persistent Tool Status

## Overview
This release fixes the annoying "Assistant Processing" message that appeared frequently in the status bar. Now the status bar intelligently remembers and displays the last used tool, providing better context about what the assistant is doing.

## Key Changes

### =' Service Status Bar Improvements
- **Removed "Assistant Processing"** - No more generic uninformative messages
- **Persistent Tool Display** - Last used tool remains visible in the status bar
- **Smart State Management** - Component remembers the last tool throughout the session
- **Better Visual Feedback** - No pulsing animation when showing historical tool status

## Technical Details

### Modified Files
- `src/multi-session/webview/components/ServiceInfoBlock.tsx` - Added state management for last tool

### Implementation
- Added `lastToolStatus` state to track the last executed tool
- Modified default behavior to show last tool instead of "Assistant Processing"
- Disabled pulsing animation for non-active states

## Benefits
- Users always see what tool was last used
- More informative status bar during idle periods
- Better understanding of assistant's actions
- Cleaner, more professional UI experience

## Installation
```bash
code --install-extension claude-chat-0.12.7.vsix
```

## Testing Notes
- Verify that tool names persist in status bar after execution
- Check that "Assistant Processing" never appears
- Ensure pulsing only occurs during active processing
- Confirm smooth transitions between different tool statuses
