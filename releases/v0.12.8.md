# Release v0.12.8 - Pure Tool Status Display

## Overview
This release completely eliminates all generic status messages ("Ready", "Assistant Processing") that were interfering with tool display. The status bar now shows only meaningful tool information and hides when there's nothing relevant to display.

## Key Changes

### <¯ Complete Status Bar Overhaul
- **Removed "Ready" text** - No more default messages overwriting tool statuses
- **Empty state handling** - Status bar hides completely when there's no tool to show
- **Clean persistence** - Uses `useRef` instead of `useState` for better performance
- **No placeholders** - Only actual tool usage is displayed

## Technical Details

### Modified Files
- `src/multi-session/webview/components/ServiceInfoBlock.tsx` - Complete rewrite of status logic

### Implementation Changes
1. Changed from `useState` to `useRef` for last tool tracking
2. Default state is now empty string instead of "Ready"
3. Component returns `null` when there's no status to display
4. Removed "Assistant Ready For Next Task" message
5. Simplified state management logic

## Benefits
- **Cleaner UI** - No distracting generic messages
- **Better focus** - Users see only what matters - the tools being used
- **Improved performance** - Using `useRef` avoids unnecessary re-renders
- **Professional appearance** - Empty state instead of placeholder text

## Installation
```bash
code --install-extension claude-chat-0.12.8.vsix
```

## Testing Notes
- Verify no "Ready" text appears anywhere
- Check that status bar hides when no tool is active
- Ensure last tool persists correctly
- Confirm smooth transitions between tools
