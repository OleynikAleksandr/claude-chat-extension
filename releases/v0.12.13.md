# Release Notes - v0.12.13

## ðŸŽ¯ Status Bar Improvement - "Assistant Ready" Message

### Changes
- Fixed status bar behavior when receiving `type: "result"` messages
- Now displays "Assistant Ready For Next Task" when assistant is waiting for user input
- Removed persistent display of the last used tool after completion

### Technical Details
- Modified `ServiceInfoBlock.tsx` to handle `type: "result"` explicitly
- Shows static text without pulsing animation when assistant is ready
- Updated documentation in `kb_AssistantStatusMonitoring_FullImplementation_001.md`

### Visual Behavior
- During tool execution: Shows tool name and target (e.g., "Read: /path/to/file.txt")
- After completion: Shows "Assistant Ready For Next Task"
- No animation when waiting for user input

This provides clearer visual feedback about the assistant's current state.
