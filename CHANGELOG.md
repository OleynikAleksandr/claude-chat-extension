## [0.10.19] - 2025-07-10

### 🎯 Critical Bug Fix: Correct Context Window Calculation

### Fixed
- ✅ **CRITICAL**: Fixed incorrect context window calculation in old sessions
- ✅ **Context Tokens**: Now correctly calculates as `cache_creation_input_tokens + cache_read_input_tokens`
- ✅ **Session Resume**: Fixed token display issues when using `claude resume` command
- ✅ **Immediate Display**: Context indicator now shows correct values from the first message
- ✅ **Summary Format Support**: Added support for new Claude Code summary format in JSONL files
- ✅ **UI Cleanup**: Removed unnecessary "tokens" line from service info block

### Technical Details
- 🔧 **Root Cause**: Previously only used `cache_read_input_tokens`, ignoring `cache_creation_input_tokens`
- 🔧 **Solution**: Parser now sums both token fields to calculate total context window
- 🔧 **Impact**: Resolves the long-standing issue where resumed sessions showed incorrect token counts (e.g., 10k instead of 107k)

### Versions
- **v0.10.16-0.10.18**: Progressive fixes and investigations
