## [0.6.5] - 2025-01-08

### 🎉 First Stable Release
This is the first fully stable version of ClaudeCodeBridge with complete bidirectional communication.

### Added
- ✅ **Complete bidirectional communication** between VS Code extension and Claude Code CLI
- ✅ **ПОТОК 1 (Extension → Terminal)**: Send messages from webview to Claude Code terminal
- ✅ **ПОТОК 2 (Terminal → Extension)**: Receive Claude responses back to webview in real-time
- ✅ **Multi-session architecture** replacing complex bidirectional bridge
- ✅ **JSONL response monitoring** with support for new Claude Code format
- ✅ **Automatic terminal management** with Enter key handling for long messages
- ✅ **Real-time file system watchers** for Claude Code JSONL files

### Fixed
- 🔧 **JSONL file selection**: Now correctly finds newest session files created after first message
- 🔧 **Response parsing**: Updated to handle new Claude Code JSONL format structure
- 🔧 **Terminal refresh**: Added force refresh for messages >200 characters
- 🔧 **Startup dialog**: Removed annoying "No terminal available" message on VS Code restart
- 🔧 **Delayed monitoring**: 3-second delay before starting JSONL monitoring to ensure file exists

### Removed
- 🗑️ **Legacy bidirectional bridge code** completely removed
- 🗑️ **TerminalManager initialization** that caused startup dialogs
- 🗑️ **ClaudeChatViewProvider** class and related components
- 🗑️ **Unused imports and commands** from extension.ts

### Performance
- ⚡ **73% size reduction**: Extension size reduced from 44.97KB to 12.01KB
- ⚡ **Cleaner architecture**: Streamlined from ~1050 lines to ~236 lines in extension.ts
- ⚡ **Faster startup**: No unnecessary terminal initialization on extension load

### Technical Details
